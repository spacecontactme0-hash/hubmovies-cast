HubMovies — Global Casting Marketplace
UI Prototype v0.1 | Live Demo | Production-grade cinematic interface

🌟 Project Vision
HubMovies exists to remove friction, opacity, and gatekeeping from global casting — replacing fragmented networks with a single, cinematic marketplace built for creatives. This UI prototype establishes the foundation for a premium, art-directed digital experience that feels intentional and human—not algorithmic.

Current Phase: Production-grade frontend prototype with mocked data. Backend, payments, and real database integration will follow.

🎬 Cinematic Aesthetic Rules
This project follows strict design principles to avoid "AI slop" and maintain artistic integrity.

Typography Rules
Primary Fonts: DM Sans (body) + Libre Baskerville (headings)

Philosophy: Bold, expressive, humanist typography defines the aesthetic

Avoid: Generic/system fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, Space Grotesk)

Approach: Editorial sensibility with character-rich typefaces

Color & Theme
Base: Dark cinematic (#0b0b0c)

Accents: Gold (#c7a24b), Red (#8f1d18)

Text: Primary (#f4f4f5), Secondary (#b5b5b7)

Rule: High-contrast dominant colors with selective accents

Avoid: Cliché AI palettes, overused gradients (purple→blue)

Motion & Interaction
Library: Framer Motion for React components

Philosophy: Purposeful animation only—no scattered or "sloppy" motions

Patterns:

Staggered reveal on page load

Fade-in + scale for hero elements

Subtle hover effects

Moving sheen across hero section

Avoid: Random or generic CSS animations

Background & Atmosphere
Base: Layered radial gradients + CSS procedural noise (no external files)

Hero: Pexels cinematic image + animated sheen overlay

Video: Deferred until user onboarding (Coverr for future motion headers)

Goal: Depth, ambiance, and identity through layered textures

Avoid: Flat solid-color backgrounds, placeholder/lorem ipsum text

Fonts imported in RootLayout.tsx

🔮 AI Continuation Guide
CRITICAL: All future development MUST respect these rules:

Design Continuity
Always reference <frontend_aesthetics> principles

Typography: Never revert to system fonts

Color: Maintain dark-cinematic base with gold/red accents

Motion: Use Framer Motion purposefully, avoid random animations

Background: Keep noise texture + sheen animations consistent

Media Sources
Portraits → Unsplash

Cinematic shots → Pexels

Motion headers → Coverr (defer video until onboarding)

Never use placeholder images or lorem ipsum

Component Rules
All buttons/CTAs trigger modals or mocked flows

Hero remains full-screen + animated until user onboarding

Maintain fixed cinematic header across all pages

Use global design tokens (CSS variables)

Page Creation Guide
When building new pages (Jobs, Talents, Pricing, How It Works, Auth, Dashboards):

Import global styles

Use established typography system

Apply cinematic color palette

Include purposeful motion

Mock backend flows with Zustand + JSON state

Ensure mobile → desktop responsiveness

Maintain hero/header consistency

State Management Pattern
typescript
// Zustand store structure
auth: { loggedIn: boolean }
role: Role
accessLevel: AccessLevel
verification: { status: boolean }
payments: { status: string }
Form Validation
Signup, Login (Zod schemas)

Post Job, Apply Job

Profile Edit, Contact forms

Always validate with Zod before mock submission

🎥 Media Attribution
All media is sourced from free platforms:

Pexels - Cinematic background images

Unsplash - Portrait photography

Coverr - Future motion video headers

Implementation Notes:

Noise background is pure CSS (no external file)

Hero video deferred—currently using animated sheen

All typography, motion, and color principles are locked

📝 Next Development Phase
Priority Pages to Build:

Jobs Listing & Detail

Talents Directory & Profiles

Pricing Plans

How It Works

Authentication Flows

Role-based Dashboards

Each must follow:

Cinematic aesthetic rules

Established component patterns

Mocked data flows

Responsive requirements

⚡ Performance Notes
CSS-based solutions preferred over external assets

Images optimized at source

Motion deferred where possible

Modular component architecture

Maintained with artistic intent. This interface rejects generic AI patterns in favor of human-directed cinematic design. Every element serves the narrative of connecting creative professionals in a global marketplace.

### Image Handling Rules

- Editorial UI sections (Hero, Talents, Jobs):
  → Use standard `<img>` tags for flexibility and portability

- Dashboard & authenticated areas:
  → Use `next/image` with configured CDNs

Reason:
Cinematic layouts prioritize visual freedom over aggressive optimization.
### Talent Profile Preview Modal

- Opens from Talents Preview cards
- Framer Motion animated entrance
- Editorial two-column layout
- Verification-gated content
- No route change (modal-based UX)

Purpose:
Reinforces premium access while preserving cinematic immersion.
Recommended changes (later)

Replace "TEMP_TALENT_ID" with the logged-in user ID.

Add proper validation and error handling.

Integrate job applied state (so “Apply” button changes to “Applied”).

Add dashboard & notifications for casting directors.
